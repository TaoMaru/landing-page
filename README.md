# landing-page
First project in TOP, a landing page.

This is a landing page. The layout is provided via picture from TOP.
The html and css are not provided, unlike with the exercises in TOP.
Thus, html and css are built from scratch and styled mostly with flexbox.
Contents: index.html, styles.css, README.md and 5 images.
Images include four minimalist pics of macarons, and one simple entranceway pic.
